#Hi, I am rhett Prince

welcome to my home repo. 
this repo lets people know about me. 

Since March of 2020, I have been coding in Python and lerning Data Science type problem solutions. 
I have used two basic types of problems to target my learning. 
First, I used python to study Information retrieval , as I learned in grad school in 2004. 
I coded my C# based search engine in python.

Next,
I wanted to analyze my stock data information. 
I learned matplotlib to produce a five panel graph of stock price and volitility data. 
Also, I coded a video representation of this information that portrayed the width between the one standard deviation  option strikes based on daily implied volitility. 
 next, 
 I added a sqlite database, I developed SQL scripts to exercise the SQL language for sqlite. 
 Scripts demonstrated Joins, ifs, and case clauses. 
 Also, sqlite likes subqueries! 
 Next, 
 I added an API component to access stock and stock option data.
 next,
 I added a Flask web app that input a stock symbol and an expiration Friday, and analyzed several stock option opening trades based on the stock and stock option greeks. 
 
 My goal is to produce google assistant app that accesses my API and whose intelligence simulates a Trading  desk Customer Service representative. 
 this this Trade desk rep can:
 quote  stock prices,
 give premium of trades that sell options like Iron condors
make trades, open trades, quote positions, and close trades based on the "Tasty trade" rules. 
see: [Tasty Trade](http://tastytrade.com)

I will consider Django REST F framework, and Fast API as well as Flask with jsonify  or some other serialization package for my solution. 

Today nearly a year later, I am wishing to enter the job market to monotize my skill as a Python programmer. 
 
 
 So, Here are my github repo's so you can see that I am not just a talker but a problem solver.
